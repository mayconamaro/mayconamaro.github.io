            <p>Check out some of my projects! You can find most of them 
                on <a href="https://github.com/mayconamaro">my github</a>. This very website
            was also completely designed and developed by me.</p>
            <ul class="projects-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>DFFinder</h3>
                    <p>A duplicate file finder written in Haskell. It calculates the <abbr>MD5</abbr> checksum of all files
                        in a folder’s entire hierarchy (all subfolders), and then lookout for duplicates. By analyzing
                        the content, this command line program finds duplicates even when they have different names.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <h3>30days30sites</h3>
                    <p>A challenge to practice websites building. The original intent is to develop one website per day,
                        but instead I rather develop each one the best way I can, taking the time needed for that. I put them
                        online when I start them. <a href="/projects/30days30sites/Day1/">Here’s the first challenge</a>. The others can be accessed by changing the day 
                        number in the URL on your browser.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Grade Dinâmica</h3>
                    <p>That’s portuguese for “Dynamic Course Syllabus”. It’s a site for interacting with the courses requirements and
                        credits, for Computer Science course at my university. I got a lot of help on this from my friend 
                        <a href="https://flavianunes.dev">Flavia Nunes</a>, an amazing 
                        UI/UX front-end developer.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>GCSHask</h3>
                    <p>That’s a project I made for a course I attended as a listener. It’s a Haskell program that reducts Graph Coloring problem
                        to Boolean Satisfaction problem (SAT). I use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mios">mios</a> as SAT Solver.
                        I did not provide a benchmark, but I can do this in the future.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Natural’s Explosion</h3>
                    <p>That’s a simple Agda proof, stating that if 0 equals 1 then all naturals are the same number. Every single definiton is made
                        directly, even the equality reasoning. I did that to practice Agda.
